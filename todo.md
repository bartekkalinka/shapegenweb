- [x] ruby & java versions unification
  - [x] same urls for services and web client
  - [x] common web client code
    - [x] static html in java
    - [x] common html + javascript code
- [ ] web client development
  - [ ] size fields
    - [ ] smaller fields
    - [ ] validation
  - [x] better zoom (times factor instead of inc/decr.)
  - [ ] stop for loop mode
- [ ] java-specific
  - [ ] actually use Spring injection and configuration for core components
  - [ ] switch to Spring Boot
  - [ ] switch to Gradle
  - [ ] rewrite in Groovy (after ruby refactorization)
    - [ ] unit tests in groovy
- [ ] unit tests
  - [ ] client code in ruby + java (consuming REST)
  - [x] shape generator unit tests where possible
    - [x] any tests before refactorization
    - [x] use some testing framework
- [ ] expand generate service
  - [x] refactorization (start with ruby version)
    - [x] shorter code (using ruby blocks)
  - [ ] dividing shape generator into layers and classes
  - [x] better tile shapes (more levels of noise)
  - [ ] number of noise levels depending on size
  - [ ] some joining mechanism for generating larger shapes in many turns
  - [ ] ruby error when generating 50 x 50 with 3 noise levels: SystemStackError - stack level too deep
- [ ] mutating shapes service (post a shape, get a mutated shape)
  - [ ] drawing shapes from client
- [ ] shape generator -> terrain generator
  - [ ] moving terrain page
    - [ ] new client page with arrows control
    - [ ] generating smooth continuation for current view
      - [ ] generate service passing base noise table used for generation
      - [ ] new service for generation + movement (noise table as parameter and result)
  - [ ] persistence service for shapes
  - [ ] placing shapes on a map
- [ ] other kinds of shapes
  - [ ] start with non-tile boundaries between two tile shapes
  - [ ] converting tile shapes to polygons
- [ ] implementations in other languages
  - [ ] scala
- [ ] text rendering as an alternative
